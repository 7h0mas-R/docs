## Updating & Maintenance

#### How do I update Volumio?

Volumio features an <a href="https://volumio.github.io/docs/User_Manual/System_updates.html">OTA (Over The Air) updater,</a> meant to allow a seamless and reliable way to update to new system versions. Please note that if you enable updating to intermediate beta/test versions, you risk making your system unreliable, and may need to carry out a 'factory reset' to the last stable version that you installed.

Caution: do not try to update your system by using 'sudo apt-get upgrade' ... this is likely to result in a non-functional system.

#### How do I do a 'factory reset?'

System settings may be returned to the first version that you installed by carrying out a 'factory reset' under 'System Settings.'  Note that you will lose all of your settings by applying this option.

#### How can I backup my settings?

It is a good idea to have a backup of your settings (NAS, playlists, webradios etc.) and this is easily achieved by use of the <a href="https://volumio.org/forum/volumio-plugins-collection-t6251.html">'Backup and Restore' plugin.</a>
