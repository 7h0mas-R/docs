To do that, several requirements :

### For your device
- Having a working __Volumio__ system (obvious)
- Having the plugin installed

### Other softwares on your computer

- REW to makes measurements <a href="https://www.roomeqwizard.com/"> : REW</a>
- Rephase to generate filters <a href="https://rephase.org/"> : Rephase</a>

### Other Hardware

 - A good Microphone. Idealy, you should use a calibrated measurements Mic. You can easily find such Microphone on internet. An usb model is about 100â‚¬
 This is a very important point. If you make your measure with a poor mic, you'll get poor results...
