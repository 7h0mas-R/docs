## Stream audio to Volumio
Volumio can be used as a renderer, receiving an audio stream from the local network, mainly through UPnP/DLNA or Airplay.

### UPnP - DLNA
* Based on upmpdcli
* IMPORTANT: use the WAV format on your source

### Airplay
* Works out of the box

### From Windows
* You can install either Stream What You Hear (SWYH), working through DLNA or TuneBlade, working through Airplay
* If you want to use this in order to stream the audio of a movie you're watching, consider that streaming necessitates a delay: use VLC to compensate this delay (J and K keys)

### From Android
* Several apps are compatible, including AirAudio, AllStram or BubbleUPnP+Xposed
